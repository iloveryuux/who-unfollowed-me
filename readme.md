## ⚙️ USAGE

You need to run the following command in your terminal.

```sh
unfollow
```

When you run the CLI for the first time, it will ask you to enter your GitHub username.

After that, whenever you run the CLI again, it will show you if anyone has recently unfollowed you or not.

If no one has unfollowed you, the CLI will also let you know this.
